# Basic_Integer_Arithmetic_C#

Wrote this simple console application to do basic integer arithmetic with 2 integers.
This is one of my earliest practice codes during when I was learning C#. It simply takes 2 integers from the user and does addition, subtraction, division
or multiplication with them depending on what operation option the user picks. It displays a menu of the operations for the user to pick from before doing the
operation and displaying the result. There's a bit of error handling in there too. Feel free to clone the repo and play with the app. 
Cheers!
